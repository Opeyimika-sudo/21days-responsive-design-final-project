# Challenge - Responsive Design Project by Kevin Powell

## Introduction
This project is the final challenge for the Kevin Powell's 21 days of Responsive Design course. I explored the use of flex and flex-directions of column and row on mobile and desktop respectively. The navbar especially challenged me but I am glad that I made it work especially the dropdown hamburger on mobile.

## Learnings
During this project, I explored the use of flexbox. I understood the usecases for flex-direction - column and flex-direction - row.

I also learned to use width, max-width, as constraints to preserve the structure of my web page.
